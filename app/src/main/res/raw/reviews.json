This 2 hours walk in different rooms and floors was totally great. To see this part of History (and aeronautics) is amazing. A whole empty airpoirt for the group where you can imagine parts of daily history but also see the details of architecture, organization, uses throughout the times etc. Highly recommanded! Be carreful to arrive 10 minutes at least before the visit starts for with your ticket.",

Great time, would recommend to anyone.\n\nAdvice: get the U6 from Friedrichstr to Paradestr the GAT (General Aviation Terminal) is a short walk from there. Once you get to the GAT door, go in and enter the first room on your left. This will have two desks and is where you sign in for the tour. You can also wait inside if you arrive to early.",

The only negative was that you barely scrape the surface of the building, considering just how many rooms it has, but naturally a tour that shows every room would be nigh on impossible. Also expect to walk lots, and there are only a couple of lifts in the building, so perhaps not the best for those who require a wheelchair, however the staff are lovely and I\u0026#039;m sure with advanced knowledge of your requirements they would be able to cater to your needs.",
